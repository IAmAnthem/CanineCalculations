# Canine Calculations for Ancient Anguish

[Ancient Anguish](http://www.anguish.org) is a MUD that has been around a long time.

A feature was introduced that allows players in the Ranger class to breed pets, and for those pets to raise their traits through breeding.

Everyone started at 0, and the traits were all unknown.  
- How many of them are there? (17)
- What are they?
  - Alertness, Appetite, Brutality, Development, Eluding, Energy
  - Evasion, Ferocity, Fortitude, Insight, Might, Nimbleness
  - Patience, Procreation, Sufficiency, Targeting, Toughness
- What do they do? Hah, who knows.  We can make some guesses by the descriptive word, but no clear definition exists.

Days were spent just figuring out the basics of getting two pets to procreate reliably.
Months were spent trying to get all traits to have a non-zero value.
More months trying to get all traits to a positive value.

Once the basics were discovered, some progress was being made, then another wrench was thrown in the works. 
RELATIONSHIPS?!  Yes, breeding between related canines produces resulting puppies between suboptimal and completely awful.

My initial efforts are to develop the logic for automating the cacluation of trait values and checking to ensure pets are unrelated for breeding.
## Why do we need scripts?
The players can only see a description of the difference between canines, not the actual values.
- "totally inferior"
- "very inferior"
- "inferior"
- "slightly inferior"
- "marginally inferior"
- "barely inferior"
- "similar"
- "barely better"
- "marginally better"
- "slightly better"
- "better"
- "much better"
- "outstandingly better"

The script will turn those descriptions into values, if you have enough known pets to compare against.

## What does the script do (right now)?
- Pick from a list of pets with known values
- Paste in the comparison text (shortcut, hit ENTER after paste - mudders ARE keyboard warriors)
- Report the number of traits 'solved'
- Continue adding comparisons to refine
- Report the known values and ranges for unknown values

## Why isn't this an open webapp?
- Poisoning: in an online world where people are anonymous, spiteful, and selfish an open website is invitation to destruction.
- Privacy: The only data you see by example here has been OK'd by the data owner.  Some players may choose to not reveal their pet lineage or stats for whatever reason.
- Skills: I'm a systems engineer by trade and at heart, I learn enough code to do what I need to do.  Currently that's PowerShell, not something sexy like the AWS stack.

### Progress Notes - what am I working on?

- Check the knowledge level

  - `if $knowledge -ne certain, abort`
  - Future development: Determine the variations in think/feel
    - Is this predictable?
    - redshift/blueshift the results based on (whatever)

- Check the relationship level?
  - not really relevant at this point
  - Futureproofing for some other need

Workup Show-Menu

- Seems good!
  - Whoops, assumed that everyone does compares in the same direction
- FIXES
  - Relabel existing funcs to explicitly state direction
    - Update Menu
  - Add new funcs to reverse direction
- ENHANCEMENT
  - Insert this pet into database (prompt for fields to fill in for real name/owner/whatnet) and updatecsv


Selecting Known Pet
- FIXES
  - Can I switch the selection menu to start counting at 1 instead of 0?
    - Pretty sure there's an example somewhere that does this
