Pick a known pet:		Get-KnownPet
	returns $knownPet

Ask for an evaluation	Get-EvalText
	returns $evalText

Check the knowledge level
		if $knowledge -ne certain, abort
		Future development: Determine the variations in think/feel
			Is this predictable?
			redshift/blueshift the results based on (whatever)

Check the relationship level?
	not really relevant at this point
	Futureproofing for some other need

Update-LowPet and Update-HighPet seem to be working correctly now.

Compare the two hashtables somehow

	Ingest them into an array like our PetDB?
```
	foreach($trait in $traitnames){
	if array.lowpet.traitname -eq array.highpet.traitname
		Solved $traitname
		spit to solution.$traitName
```
